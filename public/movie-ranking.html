<h1>The Best Movies According to Farooque</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</h2> 
<p></p>DDLJ' is An Immortal Film! It's among those "FINE" films, that remain perfect forever.</p>

<h2>Fan</h2>
<p>There's something called as the "Curse of the second half"â€‘ a phenomenon where a film is simply outstanding in the first half raising your expectations to a pinnacle only to dash them to abysmal lows after the interval.</p>

<h2>Chennai Express</h2>
<p>It breaks my heart to tell you that Chennai Express left me cold. This hyper, eager-to-please Rahul sorely tested my patience.</p>
